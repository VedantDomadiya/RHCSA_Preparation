# Week 1: RHCSA Preparation - Access Systems, Manage Files, and User Administration  

As I dive into my preparation for the **Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)** exam, I‚Äôm sharing my weekly learning highlights. This week was all about accessing systems, managing files, and user administration. I‚Äôve attached my detailed handwritten notes at the end for those who prefer a visual approach!

## 1. Access Systems and Get Support  

### SSH Without a Password or Passphrase  
One of the first things I focused on was setting up **password-less SSH authentication**, a critical step for seamless server access.  

1. **Generate an SSH Key Pair**:  
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```  
   Leave the passphrase field blank for a seamless login experience.  

2. **Copy the Public Key to the Server**:  
   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id user@remote-server
   ```  

3. **Test the Configuration**:  
   ```bash
   ssh user@remote-server
   ```  

This setup enhances security and eliminates the need for repeated password entry during SSH logins.

## 2. Manage Files from the Command Line  

### Linux File System Hierarchy  
Here are some essential directories and their purposes:  
- `/bin`: Contains essential binaries, like `ls` and `cp`.  
- `/etc`: Stores system configuration files, including `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.  
- `/var`: Variable files like logs and mail.  
- `/home`: Houses user-specific directories and data.  

### Hard Links vs. Soft Links  

| **Feature**         | **Hard Link**                                   | **Soft Link (Symlink)**                        |  
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|  
| **Definition**       | A direct reference to file data.               | A pointer to another file or directory.       |  
| **Updates**          | Changes to the original file affect the link.  | Dependent on the existence of the original.   |  
| **Cross Filesystems**| Cannot cross filesystem boundaries.            | Can link across different filesystems.        |  
| **Command**          | `ln original_file hard_link_name`              | `ln -s original_file symlink_name`            |  

These links are incredibly useful for organizing and managing files efficiently.

## 3. Manage Local Users and Groups  

### Understanding `/etc/shadow`  
The `/etc/shadow` file plays a critical role in Linux user management. Each line represents a user account and includes:  

- **`username`**: The login name.  
- **`encrypted_password`**: Stores the hashed password.  
- **`last_change`**: Number of days since the password was last changed.  
- **`min_days`**: Minimum days required before a password change.  
- **`max_days`**: Maximum number of days a password is valid.  
- **`warn`**: Warning period before password expiration.  
- **`inactive`**: Days of inactivity before the account is disabled.  
- **`expire`**: Account expiration date.  

### Using the `chage` Command  
The `chage` command helps manage user password policies.  

#### Common Use Cases:  
1. **View Password Policies**:  
   ```bash
   chage -l username
   ```  

2. **Set Maximum Password Age**:  
   ```bash
   chage -M 60 username
   ```  

3. **Force Immediate Password Change**:  
   ```bash
   chage -d 0 username
   ```
